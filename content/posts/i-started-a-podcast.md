Ehm.. I started a podcast!

This is something I should have done time ago but I never had the courage. You know, speaking in front of microphone and then let people listen.. It wasn't my nature. I am not so extrovert.

But I decided to break that mental wall and I did it! I recorded the pilot episode with a friend of mine (to better fight the initial embarrassment).

The podcast's name is: **Niente di serio**, Nothing serious in English. Episodes are mainly in Italian (sorry English speakers :pensive:).

I will try to record some episodes in English, I promise!

You can listen **Niente di serio** on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0up7BkttsAG0Z4ArJPJ83O?si=GJtVxVWgRouTDzHCpSBu6w) and on [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/niente-di-serio).
