I do like travelling and taking pictures, even if most of them are really pointless :smile:

Once back at home, I'm used to move all the pictures I took on my laptop and, after a selection, I upload the best pictures to the cloud. I like using Google Photos. But there's a problem.
Since I use the Free plan, I don't upload pictures with the original size. It means they lose quality.

That's why I decided to buy an HDD and to upload my pictures on it, not using Google Photos anymore.

Damn I miss it.

I don't have access to my pictures anymore when I'm not around my HDD. Showing and/or sharing them's impossible.

That's when the idea of the private cloud started floating in my mind.

You may say buying a HDD wasn't a cost? Pay for Google Photos then! You're right but nothing is better than the satisfaction you get by something built by yourself. I really like doing this kind of things so I made my private Google Photos! It's a full private cloud service actually - documents, video, images, emails, etc - but I use it only for my pictures.
