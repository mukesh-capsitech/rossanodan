Hello :wave:

My name is Rossano D'Angelo, I come from Italy :it: and I live in London, United Kingdom :uk:.

I like travelling :earth_americas:, reading manga :books: - after a brief but instense phase in which I was crazy for Stephen King novels. I still do like them but my attention drives me to something else at the moment.

I like coding :computer: I prefer the front-end development but lately I started taking a look to "the dark side of the moon" (I do like music too :musical_note:). Java always intrigued me but I never really worked with it. I consume APIs, don't know how to create them. I'm working on this lack in my professional life.

And finally, yes, I do have a Netflix :tv: account too. Who doesn't like watching TV series?! I started a campaing called "re-watch them!": I'm re-watching all the TV shows I liked but I watched in Italian. I lost too much because of the translation. Darn it.
